## Setup and Installation Requirements

### Cloning with Git:

* Open Git Bash, or your preferred terminal
* Navigate to your directory for Git projects (not within an existing project)
* Type the following: `git clone https://github.com/Lo-GR/CarddyPartyFrontEnd.git`

Then, open your Git Bash terminal and navigate to:

`C:<filepath the files are installed at>\CarddyPartyFrontEnd.Solution`

where "filepath the files are installed at" will be the location you saved your copy of the project at, or alternatively:  

You may navigate to the folder in the project labeled "CarddyPartyFrontEnd.Solution".  
Right-click inside the File Explorer window, and in the right-click menu, choose "Open Git Bash Here," or Shift+Right-click and choose "Open Powershell Window Here."  
This will open a Powershell/Git Bash window that is already inside the proper directory.

### Package Installation

Navigate into the `\CarddyPartyFrontEnd.Solution\CarddyPartyFrontEnd` directory. Enter the command:  

`npm install`

This command will take a little bit of time. If it doesn't appear to have fully installed, run the command again. This shouldn't happen in most cases, but has in the past.  

Once the program has installed all required dependencies, enter the command:  

`npm run start`

This will open the game in your browser.
